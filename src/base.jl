# Hands take one of several forms:
#  - A vector of cards
#  - A canonicalized form, a tuple of tuples, each tuple containing the ranks of a given suit. The canonical form has an
#       associated suit permutation sp for reconstructing the original hand. With the suit perm, it is thus equivalent
#       to the vector of cards. Without the suit perm, it is unique up to the symmetries of cribbage. Thus this form, 
#       *without* the suit perm, is used in the strategy database
#  - An Accumulator, counting the number of repetitions of each rank present in the hand. This form is for the play phase,
#       in which a card's suit is irrelevant. The Accumulator form is convenient for the recursive play algorithms.
#
# By convention, the first form will be denoted by variables containing the full string 'hand'. The second will be denoted
#   by a lowercase h, and the third by an upper case H.
#
#
# NOTE: we have hand-coded the assumption that there are four suits.

# The core object is a dataframe df containing the CFR data. Each row corresponds to one possible discard from one possible h.
# The hands h are *not* stored in df. Instead, we keep a separate dict hRows which maps each h to a range of rows. This is for
#    efficiency, since this mapping will never change.
#  - p_deal: the probability of being dealt h
#  - discard: the canonical form of each viable discard.
#  - playhand: a tuple of the ranks resulting from making the corresponding discard. Redundant info.
#  - count_dealer, count_pone: a count of how many times this discard has been chosen by the player in past games
#  - dealt_dealer, dealt_pone: a count of how many times this hand has been dealt. Only first row in each hRows block updated.
#  - regret_dealer, regret_pone: the cumulative regret from having not played this discard
#  - profile_dealer, profile_pone: the calculated strategy profile for this hand, based on regret and play count. For each h,
#      this column will sum to 1. Therefore the total column sums to the number of distinct hands h.
#  - p_play_dealer, p_play_pone: The overall strategy profile for this h + d combo. This column sums to 1.
#
# In addition to the dataframe and its row mapping hRows, there are several other supporting data structures:
#  - HRows: a dict which maps *accumulator* hands H to a list of the rows which lead to that H. Since the same H can result
#      from many different initial hands, the list is long and not contiguous (thus it is not a UnitRange).
#  - allh: a list of all distinct hands h. Equivalent to keys(hRows)
#  - allH: a list of all accumulator hands H. Equivalent (but not necessarily in sorted order) to keys(HRows) and keys(HID)
#  - hID: a dict mapping canonical hands h to sequential integer indices. Used for analytics.
#  - HID: A dict mapping accumulator hands H to sequential integer indices. Used for efficiently indexing M.
#  - Hprobs_dealer, Hprobs_pone: this is the probability of a player having a certain accumulator play hand H, based on the
#      combined probability of being dealt a hand and then choosing a discard that can lead to it. It is a sum of values
#      in the profile_xxx column at the indices given by HID[H]. This is stored separately for efficiency, because 1) this
#      value is needed often in the play solver and 2) once they are initially calculated, the values can be updated more easily
#      than by recalculating the sums. This is because after a single training hand, only the probabilities for play hands 
#      reachable from the dealt hand will change. For more details of this update step, see the core training loop.

# This format is just fine for working in-memory. Unfortunately, it's pretty slow for serialization. packFlat goes one 
#   step further, concatenating all of the tuples and storing a separate vectore recording their lengths.
# This makes for efficient serialization and deserialization; the time gained more than offsets the extra processing
#   time lost converting between FlatTrees and FlatPacks. FlatPacks are *also* somewhat less space-efficient.
# NOTE: the index tuple and the values tuple will always have the same length, except when the index tuple is empty,
#   in which case the children under consideration are leaves, and thus the corresponding value tuples have length 1.
#   This will be important when *unpacking* FlatPacks. In this case, tuple_lengths[ix] will be zero.
