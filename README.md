*A Hybrid Counterfactual Regret Minimization solver for 2-player Cribbage*

This is a learning project in several ways:
- I want to learn Julia.
- I want to get familiar with Machine Learning.
- I want to learn how to use GitHub.
- I want to beat my wife at Cribbage.

The end-result of this project will be a **database** (in a cross-platform format) plus a **solver** for playing optimally at all stages in a game of 2-player cribabge. 

I welcome comments and ideas from interested strangers, but be nice -- this is a learning project ðŸ˜¬

**CURRENT STATUS**

v2 is in an alpha state! It's been tested it on a 20-card deck (sevens through jacks) and shows good convergence.
